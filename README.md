My Name is Desmond Young. I am a Full Stack Developer that has serval years of experience in Human Resources. Before I was a Full Stack Dev, I worked as a Human Resources Data Specialist on the HRIS for Faneuil Inc. I am now searching for work in my favorite tourist destination company in Lagos, Nigeria. Nigeria is one of the faster-growing economies of the next generation, and I would love to be a part of it.
